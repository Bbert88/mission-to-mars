## Overview

![Mars](./Resources/mars.png)

This project involved web scraping multiple reputable websites to gather Mars related information and images. The Python libraries (Beautiful Soup, Splinter, Pandas, Flask) were all required to this task. The information and images were then stored and displayed via a web application which was created using Flask. The code was written in a way for the user to click a button (Picured above), which will return the most up to date Mars related data and display it.
